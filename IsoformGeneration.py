    main concept: 
    while reads_for_isoforms:
    start at s and iterate through the nodes up to t.
    Greedy approach:
    get nextnode by getting all out_edges.
    follow the edge which has
    max(current_node['reads']and nextnode['reads']
    meaning which has the maximum amount of elements which are also in current_node
    all reads that are not in nextnode are deleted from supported_reads
    One isoform:
    Supported_reads as soon as edge[1]==t
    Solve isoform by using spoa.
